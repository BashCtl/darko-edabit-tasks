/*
Recursion: Find The Longest Word

Write a recursive function that will return the longest word in a sentence.
In cases where more than one word is found, return the first one.

Examples
findLongest("I will and ever will be gratefully and perpetually loving you Tesh!ðŸ˜˜") âžž "perpetually"

findLongest("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") âžž "forever"

findLongest("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") âžž "forgetfulness"

findLongest("The word strengths is the longest and most commonly used word with a single vowel.") âžž "strengths"

Notes
Special characters and symbols don't count as part of the word.
Return the longest word found in lowercase letters.
You are expected to solve this challenge via a recursive approach.
